# FileConvert
Convert many file types using Zamzar.com's free server and API.  Easy to use program.  C# source.

A Windows Executable is also included if you don't wish to recompile.

Can convert image, audio, video, document, and other file types from one format to another.
For instance, a .pdf document can be converted to a set of .jpg images, one image per page.
Or convert a .wav file into a .mp3 file.

You do need a free ApiKey from Zamzar.com  (https://developers.zamzar.com)

There is a file size limitation with this ApiKey, and also a limit on number of
conversions in a month, currently 100.  That should be more than enough for
most people.

More information is in the READ_ME.txt file.
